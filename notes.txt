I think it would be good to do a really simple comparison using the 
rarity factor combined with the number of traits vs the price.

i.e. get all of the 1T, 2T, 3T, 4T apes into separate DF's 
- combine the rarity count for each
- decide which ones have the best value for money
- best ratio of rarity to cost basically
